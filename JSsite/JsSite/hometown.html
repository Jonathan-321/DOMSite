  <p class="description hidden">These are fishermen from a place called Braserie. They work really hard to make sure the town and the city has enough fish and proteins from Lake Kivu. The lake has great fish like tilapia and I enjoy
    hanging out during early mornings whenever I came in with my parents and close family members for an early morning swim.</p>

  <p class="description hidden">This is a beautiful panoramic view of the calm, blue waters of Lake Kivu in
    Gisenyi. Palm trees sway in the foreground with green hills rising in the background. It's a
    relaxing scene.</p>

  <p class="description hidden">This is the public road close heading to Rutriro district from Gisenyi. 
    This road is mostly travelled by cyclists in Tournaments like Tour du Rwanda and hiking amateurs since the country is full of hills. It offers
    beautiful views of Lake Kivu and the sounds of birds and Bats flying 10 feet above in the palm trees is an incredible Experiences</p>
